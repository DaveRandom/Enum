# Enum

A base class for enumerations in PHP.

This library consists of a single abstract class, which can be extended by enumerations so that they need only define
their member values as constants. A number of static methods are provided to facilitate name and value validation and
resolution.

It is intended merely as an easy way for me to share this functionality, in a highly `node_modules`-esque manner. It is
probably best that people do not do this, but #yolo.
